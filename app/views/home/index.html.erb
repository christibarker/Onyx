        <p>How do I sign up?
					After you have created a log in for yourself you will be able to sign up for classes 48 hours prior to the class time. If you have signed up for a class and are unable to come after registering  go online and cancel your class opening up your spot for someone else.
 
					<p>What do I wear?
					That depends on what class you are taking.
					Please remove all jewelry before coming into the studio.
					<br>
					<p>Pole classes- Attire should be easy to move in but cover all the apporpriate areas. Make sure to wear tight fitting shorts, a tank top with sports bra and no shoes.  Dont't put on lotion the day of your class.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Silks and Hoop- Be sure to wear long tight pants, leggings are great but wear shorts over because they do become see through when stretched</p>
					<br>
					<p>Can anyone do it?
					Yes! We have women  and men of all shapes and sizes taking our classes. We ask that if you are under 18 you have parental permission.</p>
					<br>
					<p>What can I do to help me improve in my pole and aerial classes?
					We recommend to keep a consistent workout schedule so that you are learning everything you need to know. We also have dew point, dry hands, rosin and mighty grip gloves that help improve your pole and aerial grip. We also offer private lessons after class for those wanting that one on one time.</p>
					<br>
